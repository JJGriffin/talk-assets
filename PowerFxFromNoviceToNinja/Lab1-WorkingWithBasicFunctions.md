# Lab 1 - Working with Basic Functions

In this lab, you will experiment working with the most common functions in Power Fx, using the interactive Power Fx Read, Evaluation, Print, Loop (REPL) within the PAC CLI.

## Scenario

Having just finished configuring your developer environment for Wingtip Toys, you need to start familiarising yourself with how Power Fx works, and the types of functions you can execute. You plan to use the following experiences to compare and contrast the capabilities on offer:

- The PAC CLI, within a local PowerShell terminal environment.
- A canvas app in the developer environment you provisioned in Lab 0.

Through this experimentation, you plan to gain an understanding of the core functions you will need to use every day when working with Power Fx, and how the different authoring experiences compare.

## Instructions

In this lab, you will do the following:

- Connect to your Dataverse environment using the Power Fx REPL.
- Execute some basic calculations within the PAC CLI.
- Execute some basic functions within the PAC CLI.
- Create a canvas app within the Power Apps Maker portal.
- Implement and execute basic functions within a canvas app, and see how this compares to the PAC CLI.

This lab will take approximately 30 minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that all steps have been completed in Lab 0 before proceeding with this lab.

## Exercise 1: Connect to Dataverse from the PAC CLI to execute Power Fx

1. If Visual Studio Code is not open from Lab 0, open it now.
2. Open a new terminal window by selecting **Terminal** from the top menu, and then **New Terminal**:

3. In the terminal window, type the following command and then press **Enter**:

    ```
    pac power-fx repl
    ```
4. The Power Fx REPL will start. Once connected, you will see a prompt that resembles the below. This indicates that the REPL is ready to receive new commands:

## Exercise 2: Execute basic calculations using Power Fx

## Exercise 3: Execute basic functions using Power Fx

## Exercise 4: Create a canvas app

1. Navigate to the [Power Apps Maker Portal](https://make.powerapps.com) and, if not already selected, navigate to the developer environment you created in Lab 0:
