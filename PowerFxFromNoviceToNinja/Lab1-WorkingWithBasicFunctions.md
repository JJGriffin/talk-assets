# Lab 1 - Working with Basic Functions

In this lab, you will experiment working with the most common functions in Power Fx, using the interactive Power Fx read, evaluation, print Loop within the PAC CLI.

## Scenario

Having just finished configuring your developer environment for Wingtip Toys, you need to start familiarising yourself with how Power Fx works, and the types of functions you can execute. You plan to use the following experiences to compare and contrast the capabilities on offer:

- The PAC CLI, within a local PowerShell terminal environment.
- A canvas app in the developer environment you provisioned in Lab 0.

Through this experimentation, you plan to gain an understanding of the core functions you will need to use every day when working with Power Fx, and how the different authoring experiences compare.

## Instructions

In this lab, you will do the following:

- Connect to your Dataverse environment using the interactive Power Fx read, evaluation, print Loop, within the PAC CLI.
- Execute some basic calculations within the PAC CLI.
- Execute some basic functions within the PAC CLI.
- Create a canvas app within the Power Apps Maker portal.
- Implement and execute basic functions within a canvas app, and see how this compares to the PAC CLI.

This lab will take approximately 30 minutes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that all steps have been completed in Lab 0 before proceeding with this lab.
