# Lab 3 - Using Power Fx in Canvas Power Apps

In this lab, you will create a basic canvas app that connects to Microsoft Dataverse, to allow users to view, edit and create Contact records. You will then extend the app to include a simple Power Fx formula to calculate the age of each Contact record and to display weather information relating to the Contact's location, via a Power Automate cloud flow.

## Scenario

Wingtip Toys require a simple application that allows sales people to view, edit and create Contact records. The app should also display the age of each Contact record and the current weather information for the Contact's location, to assist the sellers in conducting more personalised conversations with their customers.

Having spent some time familiarising with the fundamental capabilities of Power Fx and Power Apps, you have been tasked with creating a simple canvas app that allows the sellers to work with the Contact records, and support the additional requirements relating to the age of the Contacts and the weather information for each individual.

## Instructions

In this lab, you will do the following:

- Create a simple two screen application, with navigation between the screens.
- Customise each app screen to display a list of all Contacts and a form level view for a single Contact.
- Add a Power Fx formula to calculate the age of each Contact record.
- Add a Power Automate cloud flow to retrieve the weather information for the Contact's location.
- Review and implement recommendations from the Power Apps app checker.

This lab will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.
