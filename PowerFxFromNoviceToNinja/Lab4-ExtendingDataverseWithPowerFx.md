# Lab 4 - Extending Microsoft Dataverse with Power Fx

In this lab, you will implement customizations in Dataverse using Power Fx in modern commanding, formula columns and low-code plug-ins. Finally, you will take the canvas app created in Lab 2 and 3 and embed this into a model-driven Power App.

## Scenario


## Instructions

In this lab, you will do the following:

- Create a simple model-driven app
- Implement a custom command in Dataverse using Power Fx
- Create a formula column for the Contact table
- Implement a low-code plug-in that will validate and format a Contact's telephone number
- Embed the canvas app created in Lab 2 and 3 into the model-driven app

This lab will take approximately 45 minutes to complete.
