# Lab 3 - Advanced Development with Power Fx and Canvas Apps

In this lab, you will extend the canvas apps created in Lab 2 with more advanced Power Fx formulas, explore the various delegation options available when working with data sources in Power Apps and see how to debug a canvas app using the Monitor.

## Scenario

Having successfully created a basic canvas app that allows sales people to view, edit and create Contact records, and extended the app to include a simple Power Fx formula to calculate the age of each Contact record and to display weather information relating to the Contact's location, Wingtip Toys have asked you to further enhance the app by implementing the following requirements:

- A single screen that will allow for an Account and Contact record to be created in Dataverse via a single button click.
- Filter the existing Contact screen to only display Contacts that are external. A new field needs to be added to the Contact table, to support this requirement.

You also need to diagnose some issues with the initial version of the app that was launched to the sellers. Sellers have reported that the app is slow to load and that some of the data is not displaying correctly. You plan to use the Monitor to diagnose these issues and make the necessary changes to improve the app's performance.

## Instructions

In this lab, you will do the following:

- Extend the existing canvas app to include a new screen that allows for the creation of Account and Contact records in Dataverse.
- Add a new field to the Contact table in Dataverse to support the filtering of external Contacts.
- Implement a Power Fx formula to filter the existing Contact screen to only display Contacts that are external.
- Use the Monitor to diagnose and resolve performance issues with the app.

This lab will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.
