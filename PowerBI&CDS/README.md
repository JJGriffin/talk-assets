# Leveraging Power BI with THe Common Data Service #

## Abstract ##

With the introduction of the Power Platform, an awareness of Power BI moves from being desirable to absolutely essential when building a truly unified and engaging business application solution. But with a plethora of existing reporting options available within model-driven Power Apps and the Common Data Service (CDS), attempting to identify the best usage scenario for Power BI and the most appropriate technical architecture can be tricky. Additional complications can also arise when traditional SQL/BI developers are having to familiarise themselves with the many oddities CDS presents from a data access perspective. 

In this session, I hope to provide a "crash course" discussion on how and when to use Power BI with the CDS, before then looking at the various options available to surface CDS data and streamline the adoption of your Power BI solution.
