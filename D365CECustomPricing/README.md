# Leveraging Power BI with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement #

## Abstract ##

For years, it has been possible to override the default behaviour for sales entity calculations within Dynamics CRM, and even, today this functionality is still present in Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement (D365CE) and - arguably - more relevant than ever. For organisations who are looking to factor in custom fields, highly bespoke calculations or other non-standard business logic when producing sales quotations, orders or invoices, developing a plug-in for the CalculatePrice message remains the supported and cleanest way to achieve this requirement. This session is aimed to introduce the functionality that a custom pricing plug-in can bring to the table, and attendees should walk away from the session understanding how to develop a custom pricing solution from start to finish. Although existing C# developers with CRM/D365CE experience will gain the most from this session, no previous knowledge is assumed, and this session will be an excellent starting point for those looking to get into D365CE development within a specific and highly business relevant area.
