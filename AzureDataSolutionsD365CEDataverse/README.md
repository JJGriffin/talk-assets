# Implementing Azure Data Solutions using Dynamics 365 & Microsoft Dataverse #

## Abstract ##

Microsoft Azure is your go-to destination whenever you need to start putting your Microsoft Dataverse data to good use. Whether you want to perform batch processing activities, automated streaming of datasets or carry out big data analysis, Microsoft offers a multitude of services that are not only easy to set up but, in some cases, integrate straightforwardly alongside Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Dataverse 

Join us, [Mark Carrington](https://github.com/MarkMpn) and Joe Griffin, as we take you on a whistle-stop tour of services such as Data Factory, Data Bricks, Data Lake, Stream Analytics and more. Throughout this, we'll aim to show you how to get the most mileage out of your data and do some pretty amazing things in the process.
