# Leveraging Power BI with Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement #

## Abstract ##

With the introduction of the Power Platform, an awareness of Power BI moves from being desirable to absolutely essential when building a truly unified and engaging business application solution. But with a plethora of existing reporting options available within D365 Customer Engagement (D365CE), attempting to identify the best usage scenario for Power BI and the most appropriate technical architecture for this can be tricky. Additional complications can also arise when traditional SQL/BI developers are having to familiarise themselves with the many oddities D365CE presents from a data access perspective. 

In this session, I hope to provide a "crash course" discussion on how and when to use Power BI with D365 Customer Engagement, before then looking at the various options available to access D365CE data and streamline the adoption of your Power BI solution.
